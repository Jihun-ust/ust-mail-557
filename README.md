MS in AI Leadership Course Notebooks

Course Description

This repository hosts the official Jupyter/Colab notebooks and lesson documents for the AI Leadership Course. The course equips future leaders with both conceptual understanding and practical skills to confidently plan and lead AI initiatives in enterprise and academic settings.

From AI fundamentals to advanced agentic workflows, each module blends:
	•	Conceptual clarity (hallucination, prompting, embeddings, retrieval, evaluation, governance)
	•	Hands-on practice (Colab notebooks, policy document RAG, structured JSON pipelines, agentic control loops)
	•	Leadership perspective (risk management, collaboration playbooks, evaluation frameworks, and high-leverage moves)

Purpose

The repository serves as:
	•	A living library of course notebooks, lesson notes, and exercises.
	•	A teaching aid for faculty and facilitators to guide discussions, labs, and projects.
	•	A learning workspace for students to run, adapt, and extend real-world AI workflows.
	•	A reference archive for leaders to revisit after the course, supporting long-term impact.

Contents

Each lesson folder includes:
	•	Lesson Document (DOCX) – narrative overview with structured sub-topics (scenario, key terms, evaluation plan, leadership playbook, pitfalls, etc.)
	•	Jupyter/Colab Notebook (IPYNB) – interactive code with examples, exercises, and explorations.
	•	Sample Data/Policies (PDF, CSV, etc.) – realistic materials (HR policies, CRM exports, metrics tables) for exercises.
	•	Outputs – generated reports, JSON schemas, or evaluation results.

Example lessons:
	•	A1: What an LLM Really Is
	•	A3: Structured Outputs & Function Calling
	•	A4: Evaluation & Safety
	•	A5: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
	•	B1: Agentic Workflows
	•	B2: Governance & Safety Patterns
	•	B3: MCP and Vendor-Neutral Tooling
