    "A **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** is a supervised learning algorithm primarily used for binary classification tasks. The main goal of an SVM is to find the best boundary (called a hyperplane) that separates the two classes in your data as cleanly and confidently as possible.\n",

    "**Support vectors** are the critical data points that lie closest to the decision boundary (hyperplane). These points are essential because:\n",
    "They define the position and orientation of the optimal separating line (or hyperplane).\n",
    "The SVM only uses these points to determine the best boundary; all other data points that are further away don’t directly affect it.\n",
    "You can think of them as the most “at risk” points—if they were moved or removed, the decision boundary would shift.\n",
    "\n",
    "An SVM tries to **maximize the margin** — the distance between the separating hyperplane and the nearest support vectors from each class. \n",
    "\n",
    "The intuition is:\n",
    "\"The more space we can leave between the classes, the better the generalization will be.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple terms:\n",
    "If the boundary is too close to one class, it might misclassify new points.\n",
    "If it’s as far away as possible from both classes (i.e., maximized margin), it’s more confident and robust."
